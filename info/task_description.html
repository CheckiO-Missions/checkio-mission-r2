<p>The second part of the series dedicated to the Japanese game "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_mahjong ">riichi mahjong</a>". It's a little more complicated than the previous one.</p>

<p>Your task is to check if the hand is a winning one. If in the previous mission you were given a ready-made hand, then in this one there will be just a set of tiles in the input data, which may not be victorious.</p>

<p>Let me remind you of the conditions of victory.</p>

<ul>
 <li>There should be exactly 14 tiles in the hand.</li>
 <li>The hand must contain four sets (pona or chi) and one pair.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this mission, the second argument of the function is added â€” a list of so-called <i>open sets.</i> Such a set in the game is created by taking away a tile that the opponent discarded as unnecessary. The set that was supplemented with this tile is put aside and does not change anymore. Note that pairs cannot be open.</p>

<p>Each of the open sets needs to be checked whether it is valid or not. For example, 's456' is a valid set, and 'm124' or 'p11' is invalid.</p>

<p>One more note: there are exceptions to the second victory condition. There are two types of hands that can be winning and at the same time not contain four sets and a pair (in a real game, these hands are quite rare). Here they are:</p>
<ul>
 <li><i>Chitoisu. </i>Hand, that contains seven pairs. For example:</li>
    <pre class="brush: python">
        ['p1', 'p1', 'p5', 'p5', 'm2', 'm2', 'm6', 'm6', 's3', 's3', 's9', 's9', 'ww', 'ww']
    </pre>
    <p>Note, that there should not be two identical pairs in the hand.</p>
 <li><i>Kokushi-muso. </i>Hand, that have one and nine from each of the suits, each of the dragons, each of the winds, and a pair to any of these tiles. For example:</li>
 <pre class="brush: python">
  ['m1', 'm9', 'p1', 'p1', 'p9', 's1', 's9', 'wn', 'we', 'ws', 'ww', 'dg', 'dr', 'dw']
 </pre>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Input data: </strong> Two arguments of the list type: the first is strings encoding tiles, the second is strings encoding open sets (may be empty).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output data: </strong> One argument of the bool type: the answer to the question "is the hand ready?".
</p>

<p> 
    <strong>Example: </strong>
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">
    riichi_mahjong_win_hand(['m1', 'm2', 'm3', 'm5', 'm5', 'p2', 'p3', 'p4', 'p7', 'p8', 'p9'], ['s456']) == True
</pre>
